## Difference b/w **package-lock.json** and **package.json**
- package.json → only keeps track of versions of a small subset of installed packages
- package-lock.json → keeps track of the exact version of every package that is installed

#### Installing package-lock.json
* If the `project-lock.json` is missing
```bash
* Installing package-lock.json 
npm config set package-lock true 

* Installing dependencies 
npm install --package-lock 
```

## What is the Entry Point?
What is the entry point (package.json)?
* The entry point of any software program is the first file that runs. This file imports and runs the rest of the program.
