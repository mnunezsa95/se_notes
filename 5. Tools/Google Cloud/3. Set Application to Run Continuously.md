* Once a VM is created, and Node.js, MongoDB and Git are installed, the server can be set up to run continuously (see [[1. Creating a Remote Server (VM Instance)]], [[2. Connecting Node.js, MongoDB & Git to VM]])

#### Installing PM2 
* PM2 can be globally installed via npm
* Go to the VM 
```bash
# Run this on the VM 
sudo npm install pm2 -g
```

* Go inside the backend project, and run PM2
```bash
# Run this on the VM, in the back-end folder
pm2 start app.js 
```

#### Making the application start automatically (if it crashes or needs to restart)
* Run the following command
```bash
# Run in the VM; it will print a command in the terminal; copy and paste this command back into terminal
pm2 startup 
```

* Example of command printed from line above; run this command in terminal
```bash
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u tripleten --hp /home/tripleten 
```

* Save the settings
```bash
pm2 save 
```

#### Useful pm2 commands

```bash
# Checks the status of the application (will tell you if the process failed to start)

# Prints out the log files for the node process
pm2 logs

# Only prints out 50 lines of the logs (50 can be replaced with any number)
pm2 logs --lines 50

# disables PM2 and the application
pm2 kill 

# runs the application
pm2 start app 
```
