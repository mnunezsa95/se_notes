* Once the VM is continuously running (see [[3. Set Application to Run Continuously]]) a domain name can be registered
* Information for the public IP address of the VM is needed (see [[1. Creating a Remote Server (VM Instance)]])

# Registering Domain Names
* Register 3 different domain names
	* 2 for the frontend --> one with the `www` prefix and one without 
	* 1 for the backend 

#### 1) Creating a subdomain for the frontend
* Go to the following [freedns](https://freedns.afraid.org/) website
* Go to the subdomains section --> Click on "add a sub-domain"
	* Type --> A
	* Subdomain --> domainName
	* Domain --> A first level domain that FreeDNS offers
	* Destination --> The public UP address from the GoogleCloud
* Follow the same two steps above but for the address with `www` prefix (subdomain should start with `www.`)
	* Registering a domain with `www.` is important to ensure that the web application is accessible regardless of how users enter the domain in their web browser (with `www.` or without).

#### 2) Creating a subdomain for the backend
* Follow the same steps above, but this time add the `api.` prefix to the beginning of the subdomain name
