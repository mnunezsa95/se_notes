# Bar Charts
* Bar charts enable the comparison of numeric properties across categorical properties.
* Categories are plotted on one axis, while values are plotted on the other axis.
* Each category is represented by a bar, with the length of the bar corresponding to its value

# Histograms
- A histogram displays the frequency of different values for a variable in your dataset.
    - They are particularly useful for illustrating the distribution of a single variable.
- Reading a histogram
	- The X-axis represents the variable and includes the range of values it can take.
	- The Y-axis shows the frequency with which each value occurs.
	- A histogram divides the range of values into sections called **bins**.
	    - The appearance of the data varies depending on the number of bins used.
* Differences Between Bar Charts and Histograms
	- Difference 1:
	    - Bar charts are used to compare values of discrete variables.
	    - Histograms are used to display distributions of continuous numeric variables.
	- Difference 2:
	    - The order of bars in bar charts can be rearranged for stylistic or communicative purposes.
	    - The order of bars in histograms is fixed and cannot be changed.

# Line Plots
* A line plot represents data that is connected chronologically and each time point of data has some dependence on the previous point
	* Temperature Data
	* Traffic Data
	* Stock Market Data

# Scatterplots
* A scatterplot is a type of graph where individual points are plotted for each set of variables, but these points are not linked by lines.
- Scatterplots:
    - Aid in understanding the relationships between variables (i.e., columns) in data
    - Are useful when each data point represents a discrete, independent measurement.

# Scatter Matrix
* A Scatter Matrix is a set of pairwise plots (or a scatterplot for every possible pair of parameters)
