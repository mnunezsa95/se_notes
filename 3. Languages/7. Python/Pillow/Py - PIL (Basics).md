# Introduction to Pillow (PIL) Library
* The Pillow library, often referred to as PIL (Python Imaging Library), is a popular Python library used for working with images. It provides extensive support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. Pillow builds on top of the older PIL library, offering more features and improvements.

	1. Opening and displaying images.
	2. Manipulating images by resizing, cropping, rotating, and flipping.
	3. Adding text and shapes to images.
	4. Applying various filters and enhancements to images.
	5. Saving images in different file formats.

* It's widely used in various applications such as image processing, computer vision, web development, and more, due to its simplicity and powerful capabilities.
