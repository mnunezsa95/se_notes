#### Installing PostgreSQL
1. To install PostgreSQL Server, download the [installer here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). Make sure to download the latest version for macOS. Follow the directions
2. Select a folder for data storage, then click “Next.”
	* The program might request the host, password or port. If so, use the default settings:
		* host: localhost
		* port: 5432
		* If you installed PostgreSQL Server before but then deleted it, or you’re updating it, the system might suggest another port (5433, for example). Make sure you remember the port number, as you’ll need it later.
