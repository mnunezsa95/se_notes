The DOM tree stems from the Node object (see [[JS - What is the DOM Tree?]])

# How the DOM API is organized behind the scenes
* There are 4 types of nodes in the DOM Tree. 
	* Element nodes
	* Text nodes
	* Comment nodes
	* Document Nodes
* Nodes are able to inherit the properties and methods of their parent node (inheritance)
* Each type of node has its own methods and properties for handling data and performing tasks
