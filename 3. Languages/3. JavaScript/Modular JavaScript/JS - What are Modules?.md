### What are JavaScript Modules?
* An independent unit of code that supports a certain functionality of a program
	* A module is simply a file with some code that implements a particular functionality
* Reusable piece of code that encapsulates implementation details 
	* Used in development phase of an application (see [[JS - Modern JavaScript Development]])

### Advantages of Using Modules (All Programming Languages)
* Allows for components to be developed in isolation
* Allows for an application to be built using small building blocks
* Allows for implementation of low-level code in modules, which can be imported into other modules
* Allows for code to be reusable across multiple modules or projects
* Allows for code to be easy to maintain and stay organized

### ES6 Modules v Regular Scripts in JavaScript
* Modules need to be imported and exported in order to work (see [[JS - Importing & Exporting Modules]])
