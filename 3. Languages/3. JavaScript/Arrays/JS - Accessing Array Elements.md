Array Elements can be accessed after the array is created (see [[JS - Creating an Array]])
### Accessing Arrays
* Array elements are accessed by the **index***
	* Index --> a number that corresponds to a value's position in the array
* The index can be accessed using `[ ]` 
* The index can be used to set or change a value in an array (see [[JS - Setting or Changing Element Values]])
### Indexing in JavaScript
* Indexing is Zero-based
	* The first element has an index of 0 (not 1)
	* The second element has an index of 1 and so on...

```js
// this array contains our grocery list
let groceries = ["chips", "lemonade", "grapefruit", "orange", "juice", "milk", "eggs", "cookies", "banana", "cheese"];

// indexing in JavaScript is zero-based
groceries[0] // "chips"
groceries[1] // "lemonade"
groceries[2] // "grapefruit"
groceries[3] // "orange"
groceries[4] // "juice"
```
