# How are arrays created? 
Arrays can be created two ways
1) Manually 
2) Using the `new Array()` constructor
3) Programmatically (see [[JS - Creating Arrays Programmatically]])

### Creating an Array manually
* Can be assigned to a variable
* An array is created using square brackets `[ ]` 
* Each item should be separated by commas
```js
let variableName = [“item_1”, “item_2”, “item_3”, “item_4”]
```

### Creating an Array Using the `new Array()` constructor
* Can be assigned to a variable
* Use the `new` keyword to declare a new instance
* Use the `Array()` constructor
	* Add the items for the array inside the ( )
```js
let variableName = new Array(item1, item2, item3, item4)
```
