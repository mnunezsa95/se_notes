What is Asynchronous JavaScript? (see [[JS - Synchronous vs Asynchronous]])

### Why is Async Code important?
* Asynchronous code --> allows for the creation of API (see [[REST API - Introduction to REST API]])
* API --> a piece of software used by another piece of software to allow applications to talk to each other

### General JS & API Communication
1) JS Engine communicates with the API 
2) JS Engine waits for a response from API with data
	* JS Engine can execute other code while waiting (see [[JS - Async JavaScript Behind the Scenes]])
3) JS Engine proceed when response is received
