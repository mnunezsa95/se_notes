#### What is Correlation?
* The tendency for one variable to change in relation to the change in another variable
* Scatterplots help us answer such questions by giving us a visual representation of these relationships (see [[Py - Matplotlib (Scatterplots)]])
* There are two types of correlation
	* Positive Correlation --> as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable increases
	* Negative Correlation --> as the independent variable increases, the dependent variable decreases

#### Correlation Coefficient
* [Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) quantifies how one variable tends to change when the other variable changes using a value between `-1` and `1`.
	* `-1` = a perfectly linear negative correlation
	* `1` = a perfectly linear positive correlation
