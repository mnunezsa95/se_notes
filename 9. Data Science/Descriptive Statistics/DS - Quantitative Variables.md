#### Quantitative Variables
* Quantitative variables take values from a numerical range (e.g. 1, 2, 3.78, -100.5)
* Quantitative variables can be **discrete** or **continuous**.
	* **Continuous** variables can take a numerical value with any degree of specificity; 
		* Takes on an infinite number of possible values within a given range.
		* Examples:
			* The time a user spends on a website can be measured in minutes, seconds, or nanoseconds (or even smaller units of time, if desired)
			* Weight can be measured in pounds, ounces, kilograms, etc
	* **Discrete** variables have intervals without acceptable values in between the values it accepts
		* Countable in a finite amount of time
		* Examples:
			* The number of countries with a national search engine
			* The number of students in an online class are both discrete variables.
