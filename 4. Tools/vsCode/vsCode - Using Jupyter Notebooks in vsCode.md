#### Running Jupyter Notebooks in vsCode
To create a notebook in VS Code:
1. Press (Ctrl + Shift + P), this will open the Command Palette
2. Start typing "Jupyter" and select "Jupyter: Create New Jupyter Notebook" from the results below
3. Work as you normally would in a Jupyter notebook. For example, we wrote some code that displays a simple scatter plot with the help of the matplotlib library
4. When you are done, commit and push your work to GitHub
5. Check the GitHub repository and see how it renders your notebook on a webpage
