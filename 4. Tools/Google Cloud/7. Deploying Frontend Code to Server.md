* Once the backend data is encrypted, it is time to setup the front-end code on the server (see [[6. Data Encryption - HTTPS Protocol]])

# Pushing Frontend Code to Server & Domain
* There are several steps to achieve this:
* Resources
	* [Youtube Video: Visual Steps 4-5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=pUGln-vvY3M&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Ftripleten.com%2F&source_ve_path=MTM5MTE3LDI4NjY2&feature=emb_logo)
#### 1. Connect the backend and frontend of the application
* While under development --> frontend sends requests to a localhost site (such as `https://localhost:3001`)
* While in production --> the frontend sends requests to the production server (the domain)
* This change needs to be specified so that the `BASE_URL` used depends on the `NODE_ENV`
	* Example
```js
const BASE_URL = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
	? 'deployed-backend-url' 
	: 'http://localhost:3001'; 

//deployed-backend-url is a URL to your deployed back end (example: https://www.wtwear.mooo.com)
```

#### 2. Create an `.env` file on the remote server
* **In the backend project** locally: 
	* Install the `dotenv` module (see [[Node.js - Module - dotenv]])
	* Set up the entry point (usually app.js) to require `dotenv`
* Set JWT in the code to pull from `process.env` & a default parameter so it works locally
* Update the backend code on the server (see [[Updating Backend & Frontend Code on Server]])
* **In the VM:** Create an `.env` file on the remote server (see [[Creating and Storing Secret Keys]])
	* SSH into the VM --> Navigate to backend folder --> use: `touch .env` to create file --> run `nano .env` to enter the file --> add the required `.env` (environmental) variables
		* `NODE_ENV=production`
		* `JWT_SECRET` with a secret key for creating and verifying JWT
* This `.env` file should ONLY be stored in the server.
* Example
```bash 
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=38h3je2iodf3gb9w1he2ijw2ue219wgbe2210qhw1eh2s-1sh2eg2
```

#### 3. Update the homepage field in package.json
* Update the `homepage` field of the `package.json` file to be the registered domain name
* Example
```json
{
  "name": "se_project_express",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "The backend project creates a server for WTWR app.",
  "main": "index.js",
  "homepage": "www.wtwear.mooo.com"
}
```

#### 4. Upload the Frontend code to server
* In the VM create a folder for front-end code
* Open a terminal --> navigate to the local frontend code --> use `npm run build` --> run `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` locally 
* Run the following code 
	* `-r` option indicates that folders are to be copied recursively (subfolders in the build folder are also copies along with their content)
	* `-i` option tells `scp` to explicitly use a particular SSH key for identification when connecting. 
	* `./build/*` --> the source location; the path to local files/folders to be copied
	* `userName@domainname:/home/userName/frontend` --> the username to connect with; the domain name of the remote server and the folder on it (the destination path)
```bash
# Run this locally from the front-end folder 
scp -r -i path/to/ssh/key ./build/* userName@domainname:/home/userName/frontend
```
* Example from above
```bash
scp -r -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ./build/* mnunezsa95@wtwear.mooo.com:/home/mnunezsa95/frontend
```
* Add this code to the `deploy` script in `package.json` of the frontend
```json
{
"deploy": "npm run build && scp -r -i path/to/ssh/key ./build/* userName@domainname:/home/userName/frontend" 
}
```

#### 5. Set up nginx
* See an example of final configuration [here](https://tripleten.com/trainer/web/lesson/e8712ec1-382f-450a-b216-88ca8928f204/?from=program)

Steps:
* Go to the nginx folder by using command
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

* Copy the first block (looks like this) and paste it it below this one to form two of the same
```bash
server {
	server_name domainname.example.com www.domainname.example.com; 
	                                               api.domainname.example.com;
	location / {
		proxy_pass http://localhost:3001;
	    proxy_http_version 1.1;
	    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
	    proxy_set_header Host $host;
	    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
	}
	
	listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
	ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/domainname.example.com/fullchain.pem; 
	# managed by Certbot
	ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/domainname.example.com/privkey.pem;
	# managed by Certbot
	include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
	ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot
}
```
* For the first block, delete the two domain names that are NOT the API domain
* For the second block
	* Delete the api domain name, but leave the other two domain names
	* Add the following line of code: `root /home/userName/frontend;`
	* Delete the entire location block
	* Add a new location blow that looks like this
```bash
location / {
	try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html =404;
}
```

* Run the following commands
```bash
# To confirm that there are no errors
sudo nginx -t`

# if no errors
sudo systemctl restart nginx 
```
