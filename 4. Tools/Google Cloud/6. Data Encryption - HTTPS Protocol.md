* Once the specific ports are configured, requests can be sent to the server via HTTP (see [[5. Configuring Ports with nginx]])
	* HTTPS offers an added layer of security when sending requests

#### What is SSL?
* SSL (Secure Socket Layer) will encrypt data when being transferred between the client and server
* SSLs are issued by certificate authorities (CAs), a third party organization that issues digital certificates to validate the identity of a website.
	* Certificates are issues on the domain name and information about the server
	* CA will validate the domain name, the server IP address to which it points, to ensure that the certificate is generated by the correct domain owner.

#### Install Certbot
* Let's Encrypt's SSL certificate is issued by a tool called Certbot
* The directions for installing Certbot for (Nginx & Ubuntu 20.04) can be found on the [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) website
	* Ubuntu 20.04 already has `snap` installed, so no need to install it
```bash
# Run these commands in the VM

# Remove any existing certbot OS packages
sudo apt-get remove certbot 

# Install certbot
sudo snap install --classic certbot

# Prepare the cerbot command (link the files)
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```

#### Connect the certificate
* Connecting the certificate will ensure that all traffic coming to port 443 (the port for HTTPS requests and responses) will be encrypted.
* 
* Connect the certificate to nginx
```bash
# Run certbot using nginx
sudo certbot --nginx

# Restart nginx after issuing certificate
sudo systemctl restart nginx 
```
