Algorithm interviews are usually time-limited, so you are not expected to write production-quality code.
#### Code Quality
1) Try to keep your code as simple as possible. Avoid the following:
	* Deeply nested code
	* Too many `if` statements
	* Unclear status of the code
2) Use idioms correctly
3) Give functions and variables short, meaningful names
4) Try not to duplicate similar code
