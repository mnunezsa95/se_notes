#### Common Pitfalls & Assumptions
* There are a few aspects of tasks that interviewers won't say but are implied
	1) Assumption: The correct data is passed as input
	2) Assumption: Using standard library functions is not prohibited and is even advised in many situations.
	3) Assumption: If not clearly stated otherwise, it is assumed that your code will be running in a “single-threaded” computing environment as opposed to a “multithreaded” one
	4) Assumption: If a task requires working with strings, you can usually assume that you’re dealing with the ASCII character set (so there’s no need to figure out the encoding).
