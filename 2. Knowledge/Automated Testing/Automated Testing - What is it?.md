### What is Automated Testing?
* Allow us to run the program automatically in a number of different scenarios and ensure that it runs as expected.
	* If the program crashes during one of these tests, the problem is easier to isolate.

### Common testing frameworks
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
	* Allows for automated testing on frontend and backend (see [[JEST - Installing JEST]])
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
