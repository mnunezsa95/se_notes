## Dynamically Typed Language: `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Ruby`, `PHP`
* A dynamically-typed language means the interpreter does not check validity of any operation until the operation needs to be executed. 
	* Most dynamically typed languages do allow you to provide type information, but do not require it
* Advantages:
	* Faster to write code

## Statically Languages: `Java`, `C++`, `C`, `Rust`, `Go`
* A [statically-typed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_typing) languages means that variables types are known at compile time. 
	* For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is
* Advantages
	* All kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.
