# What is TypeScript?
* A programming language developed by Microsoft, designed on top of JavaScript, to overcome some of JavaScript's limitations.
- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it extends JavaScript's capabilities.
- TypeScript compiles down to JavaScript during runtime.

# Benefits of TypeScript
* TypeScript adds static typing to the language, allowing type checking during compile time instead of runtime.

# Drawbacks of TypeScript
* Browsers cannot interpret TypeScript directly, so a compiler is required to convert it into JavaScript.
