## What is HTML?
* HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) -- where every object on the page is an object that needs to be marked up in order to be displayed
* Objects in HTML documents are marked using 'tags', which are surrounded by angle brackets
* HTML tags are made up of an opening tag and a closing tag
* An 'html element' is composed of the tags and the content contained with them
